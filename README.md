# Ryan Skog Professional Web Development Portfolio

## Usage
This is my professional portfolio that was converted from a simple HTML/CSS design to React.js.  

My portfolio is fully responsive and can be viewed on just about any mobile device.

## Programs Used in Development
This portfolio was created with React.js, with fine-tuning using CSS3 and Bootstrap4.

## Future Improvements
I am constantly under development, as is this site.  As I learn more languages and technologies, I will be showcasing them here.  Stay posted, and check back often.
